Each circle represents a group of people with the same work-life balance and social isolation scores. Circle size shows how many people are in that group, and color shows the average of a third variable (ex. income, blue = lower, red = higher). You can hover over each circle for more details.

Average income shows little variation across work-life balance and social isolation levels. This suggests that compensation may not be directly linked to well-being in hybrid work environments.

	3,3: Most responses, regardless of income, cluster here with moderate balance and moderate isolation. 
→ Moderate balance, moderate isolation  
→ Avg. income in this group is around $X

	5,1 Ideal zone: High balance & low isolation  
→ Fewer respondents land here in the ideal zone with high balance and low isolation. This could possibly be linked to hybrid work setups.
→ Possibly linked to hybrid work setups
→ average income: 

1, 5 Red flag zone: Poor work-life balance  
→ High social isolation and low work-life balance
→ average income: 
Few respondents lie in the red flag zone with poor work life balance and high isolation. Their average income is similar to others.

Color shading shows little gender disparity in overall well-being. Both men and women appear similarly distributed across work-life balance and social isolation scores.

	Most respondents, regardless of gender, report a work-life balance score of 3 and moderate social isolation (score 2–3). This suggests a shared, middle-ground experience post-pandemic.

	Smaller clusters in the upper left show fewer respondents facing both low work-life balance and high social isolation — no strong gender trend here

	The lower-right bubbles suggest a segment of workers with excellent balance and minimal isolation. Gender distribution here is also mixed, indicating both men and women experience this positively

Most responses are centered around moderate scores (3,3). There is a slight age-related trend — older respondents cluster more at low work-life balance or high isolation extremes.

	(2, 1) Some older workers report low isolation even with poor balance — possibly due to more established support systems or routines.

	(5,5) Younger respondents may enjoy schedule flexibility but still feel isolated — highlighting generational differences in social dynamics.

	(3,3) Most workers fall in the middle range — suggesting moderate satisfaction and connection across age groups

Most clusters again fall near the center (3,2–3), with fairly uniform red-purple coloring, indicating little variation in hours worked across different experiences of isolation and balance.
There's no strong correlation between extreme isolation/balance and average working hours.
The average number of hours per week seems relatively consistent (around 50) across all clusters.
